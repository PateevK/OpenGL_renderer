Explored OpenGL and game engine development. <br>
This was one of my first rendering projects, and I plan to refactor it into a cleaner and more modular architecture.<br>

Used: C / C++, OpenGL, Glad, GLFW, ImGui, Assimp<br>

Challenges:<br>
    1. The biggest challenge was understanding how OpenGL works under the hood. I spent many hours learning the graphics pipeline and writing shaders in GLSL.<br><br>
    2. I also had to dive into linear algebra to handle 3D graphics and implement 3D transformations properly.<br>
